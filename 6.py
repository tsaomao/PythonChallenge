# Download channel.zip and look at structure.
# There is a readme. Which reads:
#   welcome to my zipped list.
#    
#   hint1: start from 90052
#   hint2: answer is inside the zip
# Guess on approach:
# Use some zip libraries to navigate through zip for info in files, starting with 90052.txt, and find
# answer. Sort of like 6.py but with zip archive handling.
# 90052.txt within ZIP archive reads:
#   Next nothing is 94191
